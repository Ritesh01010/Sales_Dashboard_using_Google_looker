## ✨ **Repository: Sales Forecasting with Google Looker Studio Dashboard**

### 📊 **Sales Prediction for Next Quarter using Machine Learning**

This project predicts **total sales for Q2 2023** using historical sales data (Q1–Q4 2022) and visualizes insights on a **dynamic dashboard** built with **Google Looker Studio**.

It leverages **Python** for data preprocessing & modeling and **Looker Studio** for interactive reporting.

---

### 🛠️ **Features**

* 📅 Aggregates sales data quarterly from raw transactions (`order_date`, `qty_ordered`, `after_discount`).
* 🤖 Implements a **Linear Regression model** to forecast next quarter’s sales.
* ✅ Calculates **model evaluation metrics**:

  * **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
  * **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
* 📈 Exports predictions in a **Looker Studio-ready CSV**.
* 🎨 Interactive dashboard shows:

  * Actual Sales (Q1–Q4 2022)
  * Predicted Sales (Q2 2023)
  * Trendlines
  * Total Sales Scorecards for every quarter
  * Model performance metrics (MAE & RMSE).

---

### ⚙️ **Tech Stack**

* **Python 3.10**

  * Pandas
  * scikit-learn
  * NumPy
* **Google Sheets**
* **Google Looker Studio**
